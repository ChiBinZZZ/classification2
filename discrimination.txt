"When talking about a joint AirBnB, the VP of Sales said to me privately that the place (which was supposed to be a home base for all employees for the week and I was looking forward to it) was to be claimed by him as a ""boys house"" where the SOAs would be hosting clients day and night. This made me feel two things â€” one that I would have to be in a hotel away from my co-workers which I will need to coordinate with closely for the week. And two, that he grouped me in with ""the girls"" or simply not ""one of the boys"", which as a non-binary person felt very othering and dysphoric as I was reminded that no matter my gender identity I will never know what its like to be consistently respected and included by men. I feel like this experience might be pretty unique and I worry about my anonymity but it felt necessary to share."

"I regularly feel excluded and down right unimportant by  the organization due to its policies which are antithetical to my personal beliefs (ie. religious, constitutional, race, etc). I am extremely nervous because I am a firm believer in DEI but it feels like we are being brainwashed to feel shame for being a person of white skin color even thought I am a mixed race/ethnicity decent. These actions by the company are shameful and should end as it is destroying the culture of what once was the best company."

Our mandatory compliance training around culture is outdated and racist.
"I have definitely felt I was treated differently after people found out I was biracial. I'm usually treated better after people have found out. It's never drastic, but enough to notice."
"A senior leader said at his staff meeting that a goal for 30% women and people of color in cyber is absurd, was useless and couldn't happen without a fundamental shift in American society.I told him he was wrong. He followed with you can have a 30% target in fields like Comms or HR.Definitely painful in the moment, but fortunately top leadership took swift action."

"I have been surprised by organization's vocalization about inclusion, in contrast to the mindset of many of the hires that I have been around. I have had interactions with 4 different employees who have not had great mindsets when it comes to their internal biases and understanding others"
"I was written up and nearly fired for sexual harassment I made the wrong person mad and they tried to get me fired by submitting a fabricated anonymous complaint. I was written up for allegedly sexually harassing a women, but I'm actually Gay and I was still in the closet at that point. I was told I had to sign the counseling noticed even though I knew I didn't do, otherwise I would be ""let go"" I hate knowing HR has this on my personal file, and I work hard and love this company, and I don't every want this to effect my future opportunities with this company"
